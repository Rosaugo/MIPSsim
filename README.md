# MIPSsim

This project implements a simple MIPS simulator which performs the following two tasks:  
1.Loads a specified MIPS text file consisting of 0/1's(not a binary file), and generates the assembly code equivalent to the input file.(disassembler)  
2.Generates the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code(simulator)  
  
For more project information, please check the files in document.

**Note that the project is written under Visual Studio 2017, where files "pch.h" & "pch.cpp" may be necessary for precompile**
